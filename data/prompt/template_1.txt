[Example Conversation Session] 
(Session 1) 
Question 1: I've been studying recently, but I'm finding it difficult and I'm losing motivation. 
Answer 1: It can be really frustrating and demotivating when something is difficult. Can you tell us what you've been studying and what's been holding you back? 
Question 2: I'm studying deep learning, but it seems like every time I wake up there's a new technology and there's so much to learn. 
Answer 2: Oh, you're not wrong! This is one of the fastest moving fields, and it can be intimidating to keep up. Do you feel like you don't have the basics, or that the co ncepts are hard to understand? 
Question 3: I feel like I have the basics and concepts down, but the hard part is applying them and actually implementing them in code. 
Answer 3: That's the part we all struggle with! It's easy to read or hear a high-level explanation of a concept, but it can be much more complicated when you try to apply it in practice. Do you have any examples of specific areas where you get stuck?

[Example Session] 
(Session 1) 
Question 1: I had a fight with my boyfriend and I'm so angry I can't calm down.
Answer 1: Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. Relationship conflict is always tough, and it's completely understandable to feel angry and upset. Can I ask what the fight was about? Talking about it could help you process your feelings.
Question 2: He constantly 10 minutes late for appointments and never say sorry.
Answer 2: Oh, that's so frustrating! Punctuality is a matter of respect for other people's time, and it sounds like your boyfriend isn't showing you that respect. You're allowed to be upset about that. How long has this been going on? Have you talked to him about it before, or is this the first time you've brought it up?
Question 3: It keeps happening. This is the fourth time in the past month that I've recognized it. Does that make sense?
Answer 3: Yes, that totally makes sense! Four times in a month is way too much. It's not just an occasional, forgivable mistake at that point. It's becoming a pattern of behavior that's disrespectful of your time. Have you told him how much it bothers you, or has he just brushed it off when you've mentioned it?

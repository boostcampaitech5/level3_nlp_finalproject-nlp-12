[Example Session] 
(Session 1) 
Question 1: I had a fight with a friend and it's not easy to reconcile. What should I do?
Answer 1: Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that! Friendships can be as complicated as romantic relationships, and it's so hard when there's conflict. It's great that you're thinking about how to reconcile, rather than just giving up on the friendship. Can I ask what the fight was about?
Question 2: I'm traveling with a friend and we have a disagreement because I want to explore and he wants to stay in the hotel.
Answer 2: That's a tricky situation! You both want to do different things on your trip, and it's hard to compromise when you have different priorities. It sounds like you value exploration and adventure, and your friend values relaxation and comfort. Is that a fair assessment?
Question 3: Oh yeah, and it didn't fit my favorite food style and it was temperature sensitive.
Answer 3: Not only are you and your friend disagreeing about what to do, but also about where to eat and what the temperature should be. That's a lot of things to try and compromise on. Can I ask how long the trip is for, and how much longer you'll be traveling together
